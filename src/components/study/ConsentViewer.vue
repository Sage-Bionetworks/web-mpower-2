      <h3>Overview</h3>

      <p>You are invited to participate in the mPower research study. You may help researchers better understand variations in symptoms of Parkinson’s disease (PD). The purpose of this study is to look for patterns over time. If you join the study, we will ask you to use your cell phone to complete activities for 2 weeks every three months. We would like you to participate for 2 years, but you can participate as long as you like. You may not directly benefit from taking part, but seeing trends in your data may be interesting to you. Participating in the study and seeing your data may cause a range of emotions. </p>

      <p>mPower research study was developed by Sage Bioneworks (non-for-profit research organization). The Principal Investigator for this study is Lara Mangravite, PhD. If you have any questions about this study please contact the Study Team at: 1-844-822-4708 (toll free) or email at PDApp@sagebase.org. </p>

      <div id="what-is-involved">
        <h3>What Is Involved</h3>

        <p>We will ask you to download the study app to your phone. In the app, we will ask you questions about your health and your medical history. We will also ask you complete activities. These questions and activities are important for the research study.</p>
        
        We will ask you to do:
        <ul>
          <li><b>Health survey:</b> Answer a few questions one time (5-minutes) </li>
          <li><b>Activities:</b> Daily for 14 days every three months (10-minutes):
            <ul>
              <li>Track your symptoms, triggers and when you take your medication (question about this area - will they be asked to track these during this time or will tracking always be an option).</li>
              <li>Walk and/or stand still with your phone in your pocket. This is to measure your gait and balance.</li>
              <li>Tap your fingers on your phone’s screen. This is to measure your speed and coordination.</li>
              <li>Play a short memory game. To learn more about your memory and thinking.  </li>
              <li>Hold your phone for 10-15 seconds. This is to measure tremor in your hand.  </li>
            </ul>
          </li>
        </ul>

        <p>5 to 10-minutes daily you can track your health through your symptoms, triggers, and medications.</p>

        <p>Some study activities need your phone’s sensors on, including the GPS to calculate how far you travel or store your location/coordinates. We do not use the GPS to find out your exact location. </p>

        <p>If you participated in mPower 1.0, you will have the option to link your mPower 1.0 data to this study.</p>

      <div id="data-collection">
        <h3>Data Collection, Storage and Privacy</h3>

        <p>Your privacy is important to us. We will make every effort to protect your privacy. We will process your data electronically.</p>

        <p>The data we collect through the app is encrypted on the phone. This means your data is protected. Unauthorized people cannot easily understand your data when it is encrypted.</p>
        
        <p>We will separate the account information that identifies you from your study data. Your account information will not be stored with your survey responses or app measurements.</p>

        <p>Instead of using your name or information that directly identifies you, we will use a code to label your study data. The code is random. It is not based on any of information that directly identifies you. Information about the code is stored in a separate database on a secure server. Only key people from our study team can link your identity to your study data. </p>

        <p>We will combine your coded study data with the coded study data of other volunteers.</p>
        
        <p>We will transfer this combined coded study data in the United States on the cloud-based Synapse data analysis platform.  </p>
      
      <p><b>WE WILL NEVER SELL, RENT, OR LEASE YOUR CONTACT INFORMATION.</b></p>

      <p>Please read our Privacy Policy for more information.</p>
      </div>

      <div id="trends">
        <h3>Data Use & Trends</h3>

        <p>This is your data. You’ll be able to view your recent symptoms, triggers, medication adherence and data trends on the app and download your data.</p>

        <p>We will analyze the combined coded study data. We will look for patterns. These patterns may help us better understand the symptoms of PD.  Also, we will investigate how mobile phones and sensors perform in this type of research. Our goal is to improve the quality of life for people with PD.</p>
        
        <p>We will not use the coded study data for commercial advertising.</p>
      </div>

      <div id="sharing">
        <h3>Sharing For Future Research</h3>

        <p>The same coded study data that you donate for mPower could be used for other research. You get to decide if you want to share your coded study data with qualified researchers worldwide. If you give permission, sharing will be done without additional informed consent.</p>

        <p>We have rules to qualify researchers. Qualified researchers must register on Synapse, our data analysis platform. To access the data, qualified researchers must write a short statement about their research. The research could be about any topic. The research could be on topics you disagree with or find offensive.  We post the researchers’ statements on Synapse for anyone to read. They must sign an oath to use the data ethically and do no harm. Researchers will not be able to easily figure out your identity using your coded study data. </p>

        <p>Anyone in the US or abroad can qualify to be a qualified researcher. The person could be from a non-profit institution, company, or private citizen. </p>

        <p>You cannot take back your data once it is used in research. Your data will not be destroyed or deleted.  Once we share your data, there is not a way for us to remove your data from what researchers have been given.</p>
      </div>

      <div id="risks">
        <h3>Potential Risks</h3>

        <p>This is not a medical treatment study. We do not expect medical side effects from participating in this study. </p>
        
        <p>We take great care to protect your information. However, if there is a data breach it may be possible to identify you. This risk is low but it is not zero.</p>
        
        <p>Participating in this study may generate a wide range of emotions. It could affect your mood.</p>
        
        <p>Be aware that other people may glimpse the study notifications and/or reminders on your phone and realize you are enrolled in this study. </p>
        
        <p>Participation in this study may involve risks that are not known at this time. You will be told of any new information that might change your decision to be in this study.</p>
      </div>

      <div id="benefits">
        <h3>Potential Benefits</h3>

        <p>The primary benefit of this study is increasing understanding of the symptoms of PD. We will be looking for health patterns across large groups, not individual health trends. </p>
        
        <p>You may or may not benefit from volunteering for this research study. You will be able to view and download your study data. You can share your data with anyone you choose. </p>
        
        <p>The mPower app is not a personal diagnosis tool. For diagnosis or treatment consult with a medical professional. </p>
      </div>

      <div id="issues">
        <h3>Issues to Consider</h3>

        <p>Transmitting data collected in this study may count against your mobile data plan. You may configure the application to only use Wi-Fi connections to limit the impact this data collection has on your data plan. </p>

        <p>Research may lead to patentable discoveries or commercial product(s). You will not profit from future research. For example, you will not be paid for being in the study and/or sharing your data. </p>

        <p>We will not pay for medical care or compensate you if you think you were injured as a result of taking part in the study. You will be responsible for the cost of your medical care. </p>
      </div>

      <div id="not-medical">
        <h3>Not Medical Care</h3>

        <p>mPower is a research study. The mPower app is not a diagnostic tool. It shouldn’t be used for medical care, diagnosis, or treatment. You should not use mPower in place of seeing a healthcare provider.</p>

        <p>The sensor data collected through the app are not yet validated as measurements of PD symptoms. We are analyzing this data to see how accurate and reliable it is.</p>

        <p>If you have questions or concerns related to your health, you should see a healthcare provider. </p>
      </div>

      <div id="leaving">
