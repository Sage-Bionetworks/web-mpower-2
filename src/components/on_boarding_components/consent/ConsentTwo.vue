                    One activity we will ask you to complete is the 6 Minute Walk where you will walk as far as you can in 6 minutes. The sensors in your phone will tell us how far you have walked to measure your fitness levels. You donâ€™t have to run or exercise heavily to complete this activity.

                    To tell us your heart rate, we will ask you to measure the number of times your heart beats in a minute using the sensors in your iPhone or Apple Watch. We will provide instructions on how to do this when it is time.
