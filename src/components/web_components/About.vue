                The elevateMS study, developed in collaboration by Sage Bionetworks (nonprofit) and Novartis
                Pharmaceuticals Corporation, monitors wellbeing and changes in selected symptoms of MS such 
                as dexterity, balance or gait.

                The app lets you record your own story of living with or without active symptoms and allows you to securely share information with researchers.
                Sage Bionetworks developed the free elevateMS app to be a research tool that may also help you track your symptoms whenever you want. 
                It is about you in real life. You are in charge.

                So long as you are 18 years old or older, live in the U.S.
                and have a personal iPhone (model 5 or newer with iOS 8 or later), then you can join elevateMS. You do not need to have MS to join this study 
                and make a difference in the lives of people affected by MS.
