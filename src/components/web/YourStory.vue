          <h2>Living with Parkinson’s Disease</h2>
          <p>We understand that living with Parkinson’s Disease (PD) can be unsettling due to the uncertain nature of the disease.  Unlike many other conditions, symptoms and the way they change over time are different for each person. Due to the irregular and unique progression of PD, you don’t always know when your symptoms will evolve and how disease will impact your life over time. </p>

            <h3>Understand your PD</h3>
            <p>Although your path is uncertain, seeing patterns over time may lead to a better understanding of your PD. Tracking your medication and other factors (e.g. stress, exercise) may provide insight into your symptoms and your ability to complete activities.  Understanding this may provide insights into your day to day health and lifestyle.</p>
