          <h2>About the study</h2>

          <p>mPower is a free, 2 year mobile research study developed by Sage Bionetworks (nonprofit), with the goal of understanding the progression of Parkinson’s Disease that appears to be unique to individuals. </p>
  
          <p>Unlike many other conditions, Parkinson’s Disease can be uncertain and change over time for each person. mPower allows you to understand your unique story of Parkinson’s Disease. Through physical and cognitive activities, symptom, medication, and trigger tracking, you can learn your symptoms, factors, and how these relate to your medications. These insights allow both you and the Sage Bionetworks team to understand your unique patterns over time. This understanding allows for better conversations with your doctors and caregivers, insight into your day to day health and lifestyle, and potential to make a difference in the lives of people who are affected by Parkinson’s Disease. </p>
  
          <p>You do not need to have Parkinson’s Disease to join this study. If you are 18 years old or older, live in the U.S. and have a personal mobile phone, then you can join mPower and make a difference in helping us to better understand Parkinson’s Disease. </p>

            <h3>Scientists make discoveries</h3>
            <p>When you use the app you contribute to research on PD. By combining information from many people who are using the app, researchers expect to find patterns. The information you provide through the mPower app gets encrypted on the phone to protect your privacy. As you participate over time, you help create a powerful dataset that may lead to a scientific breakthrough and to new ways to help people with PD improve their well being. You do not need to have PD to participate. We will ask you to participate for 2 weeks every three months. The study will last 2 years but you can participate as long as you like.</p>
